# Writings
Welcome to my collection of technical writing and programming projects. Here, you'll find articles, essays, stories, and small coding projects, ranging from early drafts to polished pieces, reflecting my exploration of ideas and creativity across different genres. 

  **I will implement these in the upcoming timeframe:**
- custom_malloc() and custom_free()
- file system in C using indexed allocation
